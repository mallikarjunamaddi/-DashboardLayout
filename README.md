This project is a POC on demonstrating dynamic layouts. Dynamic layouts allows us to arrange the items in the dashboard. It provides options such as change position, resize, add item, delete item and many other interesting features.

## Steps to start the application

- Run `npm install` to install all dependent packages.
- Run `ng serve` to start the server.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
